### Overview
This repository contains an implmentation of the Vision Transformer, as desribed in the ICLR2021 Paper An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers For Image Recognition at Scale (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf) in PyTorch. The original repository of the code (implemented in JAX) is available at: https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer.
